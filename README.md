### Quick Start

Local Test Setup

#### First, we need to install a Python 3 virtual environment with:

sudo apt-get install python3-venv

#### Create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv python_venv

#### You need to activate the virtual environment when you want to use it:

source python_venv/bin/activate

#### To fufill all the requirements for the python server, you need to run:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

#### Because we are now inside a virtual environment. We do not need sudo.

Then you can start the server with:

python3 main.py

### This quickstart was used from an example from Dr. Wu which uses the same basic flask tasks, the original is linked below.
